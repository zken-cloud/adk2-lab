# Deploy the Timed Trigger Agent

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy your workflow agent to Agent Engine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have authenticated with Google Cloud:
```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Your GCP `project` and `location` should be set in a `.env` file in the root of this project. The agent is already configured to load these values.

## Deployment Steps

1.  **Deploy the Agent using ADK CLI**

    From your terminal, run the following command to deploy your agent. This command will package your agent and deploy it to Vertex AI Agent Engine.

    ```sh
    adk deploy triggers/agent.py:root_agent --display-name "Morning Email Agent"
    ```

    This process can take a few minutes. Upon completion, your agent will be deployed and ready to be triggered.

2.  **Triggering the Agent**

    Once deployed, you can trigger your agent. For a timed trigger, you would typically use a scheduler service like Cloud Scheduler to invoke the agent's endpoint at your desired time (e.g., every morning at 9:00 am).

## Setting up a Timed Trigger with Cloud Scheduler

To automate the execution of your deployed agent at a specific time (e.g., 9 AM every morning), you can leverage Google Cloud Scheduler.

### Prerequisites for Cloud Scheduler

*   Your agent must already be deployed to Agent Engine.
*   You need the HTTPS endpoint URL of your deployed agent. This URL is provided in the `adk deploy` command output or can be found in the Google Cloud Console under Vertex AI > Agent Engine.
*   Ensure you have the necessary `gcloud` CLI components installed and authenticated.

### Cloud Scheduler Configuration Steps

1.  **Create a Service Account for the Scheduler**

    It's a security best practice for Cloud Scheduler to use a dedicated service account to invoke your agent.
    ```sh
    gcloud iam service-accounts create scheduler-invoker --display-name "Scheduler Invoker"
    ```

2.  **Grant Invoker Permissions to the Service Account**

    Grant the service account permission to invoke your Agent Engine service. Replace `[YOUR_AGENT_DISPLAY_NAME]` with the actual display name you used during deployment (e.g., "Morning Email Agent"), and `[YOUR_GCP_LOCATION]` with the GCP location where your agent is deployed.
    ```sh
    gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding [YOUR_AGENT_DISPLAY_NAME] 
        --member="serviceAccount:scheduler-invoker@$(gcloud config get-value project).iam.gserviceaccount.com" 
        --role="roles/run.invoker" 
        --region="[YOUR_GCP_LOCATION]"
    ```

3.  **Create the Cloud Scheduler Job**

    This command creates the Cloud Scheduler job that will trigger your agent daily at 9:00 AM (0 9 * * *). Remember to replace `[YOUR_AGENT_ENDPOINT_URL]` with the actual HTTPS endpoint of your deployed agent and `[YOUR_GCP_LOCATION]` with your agent's deployment location.

    ```sh
    gcloud scheduler jobs create http daily-email-agent-trigger 
        --schedule="0 9 * * *" 
        --uri="[YOUR_AGENT_ENDPOINT_URL]" 
        --http-method="POST" 
        --oidc-service-account-email="scheduler-invoker@$(gcloud config get-value project).iam.gserviceaccount.com" 
        --oidc-token-audience="[YOUR_AGENT_ENDPOINT_URL]" 
        --location="[YOUR_GCP_LOCATION]"
    ```

After completing these steps, your Cloud Scheduler job will be active and will trigger your "Morning Email Agent" every day at 9:00 AM. You can manage and monitor this job from the Cloud Scheduler page in the Google Cloud Console.
